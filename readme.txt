Add a list of your accepted contributions to WordPress Core as a sidebar widget.

== Description ==

A lot of people write code.  A lot of people write WordPress plugins.  A lot of people write WordPress themes.  But only a handful of people contribute code back to the core WordPress project.  Take a second to show off the patches that you've submitted that have made it into core.  It's a great way to highlight your coding credentials and back up your resume.

== Installation ==

=== Manual Installation ===

1. Upload the entire `wp-core-contributions-widget` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Add the WP Core Contributions Widget to your sidebar (be sure to enter your Trac username!)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Not all of my patches show up, what's wrong? =

The Regular Expressions the system uses aren't perfect.  They catch the *majority* of your patches, but are bound to miss one or two due to inconsistent messages left by core committers.  If there are a *lot* of your patches missing, please report the issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/ericmann/WP-Core-Contributions-Widget).
